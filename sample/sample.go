//
// Metropolis-Hastings is a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm that generates
// samples according to the distribution specified by target by using the Markov
// chain implicitly defined by the proposal distribution. At each
// iteration, a proposal point is generated randomly from the current location.
// This proposal point is accepted with probability
//  p = min(1, (target(new) * proposal(current|new)) / (target(current) * proposal(new|current)))
// If the new location is accepted, it is stored into samples and becomes the
// new current location. If it is rejected, the current location remains and
// is stored into samples. Thus, a location is stored into samples at every iteration.
//
// The samples in Metropolis Hastings are correlated with one another through the
// Markov-Chain. As a result, the initial value can have a significant influence
// on the early samples, and so typically, the first sapmles generated by the chain.
// are ignored. This is known as "burn-in", and can be accomplished with slicing.
// The best choice for burn-in length will depend on the sampling and the target
// distribution.
//
// Many choose to have a sampling "rate" where a number of samples
// are ignored in between each kept sample. This helps decorrelate
// the samples from one another, but also reduces the number of available samples.
// A sampling rate can be implemented with successive calls to MetropolisHastings.
